# What is this?
A starter typescript based fullstack setup that uses Vue for the UI, Koa for APIs and Mongo as a database. The stack is based on personal preferrence.

# Why a Monorepo
The reasons are many, however here is what I find the most important reason. With my usual fullstack applications, my branches are named basis feature or bugs/hotfixes. The feature as a whole is not concerned if it's a front end or backend change. It's usually both. having a mono repo saves us from keeping a track of multiple repositories that belong to the same feature. At any given point, a branch has both client and server code that works together.

# Customization
You may not always want to use Vue and plugging in your choice of UI framework is possible although it may require a modifications.
Similarly for Koa and Mongo. Maybe a CLI would be nice? Is there a need/demand for that. Please let me know.
